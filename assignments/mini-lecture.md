# Mini-lecture

See syllabus for dates and see Blackboard announcement for time slot sign-up sheet.

In this assignment you will practice learning and applying a new method on your own, and then demonstrating it to the class. Teaching someone else how to do something you've learned is a key skill in data analytics in both research and practice. You will create an 8-10 minute mini-lecture demonstrating a method during modules 11 or 13. An example of a "method" would be random forest or k-means.

Instructions:

  - Pick a method listed in the syllabus for those weeks or covered in the reading material.
  - Learn how the method works by reading the week's reading material.
  - Practice the method in your own notebook on your own data.
  - Google for additional usage examples and further information.
  - Prepare a 8-10 minute mini-lecture that 1) briefly introduces why someone would use the method and how it works (~2 minutes), 2) demonstrates in code how to use the method for a simple data analysis (~5 minutes), 3) summarizes what the analysis revealed (~2 minutes).
  - Deliver your mini-lecture during the timeslot you signed up for, using either a slide deck or a lecture notebook you created.

8 minutes is not a lot of time, so keep your lecture simple and brief. Have a clean dataset ready to go at the beginning of your lecture. Do not show us a lot of preparatory steps setting things up. Jump right into the analysis that demonstrates your method.

You will be graded according to the following. Did you:

  - adhere to the requested timeframes
  - summarize why someone would use this method and how it works, at a high-level
  - demonstrate the method with a simple data analysis
  - summarize what your analysis revealed

This exercise is intended to be informal and an opportunity for self-discovery. Go find something interesting, play around with it, and show us all what you figured out!
